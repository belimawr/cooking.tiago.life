The flour should be well cooked (aka no flour taste). Dark chocolate chips will add creaminess and richness of flavour, white chocolate chips will add colour contrast and sweetness.
If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and don&amp;rsquo;t like super sweet desserts, use 1 tbsp of dark chocolate chips and 1 tbsp of white chocolate chips.</description></item><item><title>Scrambled Tofu</title><link>https://cooking.tiago.life/recipes/scrambled-tofu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 15:36:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cooking.tiago.life/recipes/scrambled-tofu/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s my favourite breakfast! You can side it with any sort of bread, I usually use whole grain tortillas (and make it into a quesadilla, like in the photo), but it goes well with any sort of bread.
Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to make a nice presentation, I always garnish mine with spring onions and add some nuts on the side.
The coconut yogurt is there to give it a creamy texture, so you can easily replace it with any cream or mayo.</description></item></channel></rss>
