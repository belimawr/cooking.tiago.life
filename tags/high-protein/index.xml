You can side it with any sort of bread, I usually use whole grain tortillas (and make it into a quesadilla, like in the photo), but it goes well with any sort of bread.
Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to make a nice presentation, I always garnish mine with spring onions and add some nuts on the side.
The coconut yogurt is there to give it a creamy texture, so you can easily replace it with any cream or mayo.</description></item></channel></rss>
