yield: 1 breakfast
prepTime: 5 min
cookTime: 8 min

tools:
- Non-stick frying pan

ingredients:
- 2 tbsp Scrambled Tofu Seasoning
- 100g firm tofu
- 1/2 bell pepper (red, orange or yellow) (or 50g)
- 1 spring onion
- 4 to 6 tbsp plant-based coconut yogurt (or any plant based cream, or vegan mayo).
- Bread or tortilla (preferable sourdough whole grain)

components:
- Scrambled Tofu Seasoning

directions:
- Wash and clean the bell pepper and spring onion
- Slice the bell pepper as thin as possible (long side)
- Turn the bell pepper 90˚ and slice again as thin as possible (you
  will end up with very tiny and thin pieces of bell pepper)
- Separate the green part from the white (onion-ish) part of the spring onion
- Slice the white part of the spring onion as thin as possible
- Make thin slices from the green part of the spring onion in a 45˚
  angle. You want to end up small diamond shaped pieces
- Separate some of the greens for garnishing
- Heat up the frying pan on medium-high heat (about 175˚ C)
- Turn the heat down to medium
- Crumble up the tofu with your hands directly over the pan
- Add 2 tbsp of coconut yogurt and mix until the tofu have absorbed
  the yogurt (you will notice a change in texture)
- Add the bell pepper and spring onion (green and white parts)
- Mix well
- Let it cook for 3 to 5 min, stirring occasionally, until the tofu
  starts to get golden-brown
- Turn off the heat
- Add 1 tbsp of scrambled tofu seasoning
- Mix well and taste
- Add more seasoning if desired (I use 2)
- Add 2 tbsp of coconut yogurt
- Check the creaminess, add more if necessary
- Taste again and add more seasoning if necessary
- Plate and garnish with some green spring onions on top

That's my favourite breakfast! You can side it with any sort of bread,
I usually use whole grain tortillas (and make it into a quesadilla,
like in the photo), but it goes well with any sort of bread.

Don't forget to make a nice presentation, I always garnish mine with
spring onions and add some nuts on the side.

The coconut yogurt is there to give it a creamy texture, so
you can easily replace it with any cream or mayo. Try and see what
works best for you.
