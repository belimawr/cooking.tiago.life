The goal is achieve something like in the photo, the centre is set,
but the sides are still a bit runny. The flour should be well cooked
(aka no flour taste). Dark chocolate chips will add creaminess and
richness of flavour, white chocolate chips will add colour contrast
and sweetness.

If you're like me and don't like super sweet desserts, use 1 tbsp of
dark chocolate chips and 1 tbsp of white chocolate chips.

It takes a few tries to get the perfect microwave setting. Bear in
mind that cooking in the microwave for 90s will yeld a different
result than cooking for 60s them for 30 more seconds.
